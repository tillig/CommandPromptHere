# Command Prompt Here Generator

![CI/CD](https://github.com/tillig/CommandPromptHere/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)

This silly little app generates the `.inf` installers for "Command Prompt Here" power tools in Windows. It used to be a web forms app but I switched it to 100% client-side because it's not that complex and I wanted to experiment with React.js.
