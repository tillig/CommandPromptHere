# Command Prompt Here Generator

This silly little app is a web forms app that generates the `.inf` installers for "Command Prompt Here" power tools in Windows.

It's not the coolest looking app and it uses web forms because I wrote it as an excuse to try out the "wizard" control (remember that?) a long time back. But it works, and you can extend it to add new command prompt types pretty easily. When new versions of VS come out, I generally update for that.
